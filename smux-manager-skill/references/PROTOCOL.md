# Smux Manager Protocol

This protocol assumes a **manager pane** talking to one or more **worker panes** over `tmux-bridge`.

## Design goals

- Human-readable in a pane
- Machine-friendly enough for helper scripts
- Single-line envelopes for control traffic
- Long outputs moved to artifact files

## Required message types

- `HELLO`
- `TASK_ASSIGN`
- `TASK_ACCEPT`
- `HEARTBEAT`
- `STATUS`
- `ASK`
- `RESULT`
- `FAIL`

## Envelope format

Keep the control line on one line:

```text
[role type:VERB task:task-123 worker:codex seq:45 reply:%0 context_seq:110 lease_token:lease-task-123]
```

Optional payload may follow on the same line after the bracket:

```text
[mgr type:TASK_ASSIGN task:task-123 worker:codex seq:45 reply:%0 context_seq:110 lease_token:lease-task-123] goal="Investigate failing auth tests" input="tests/ src/auth.ts" artifact_dir="/tmp/smux/artifacts"
```

## Field meanings

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | `mgr` or `wrk` |
| `type` | Protocol verb |
| `task` | Stable task identifier |
| `worker` | Logical worker identifier |
| `seq` | Monotonic sequence number from the sender |
| `reply` | Manager pane target to reply to |
| `context_seq` | Latest shared context sequence the sender expects |
| `lease_token` | Assignment token echoed back by the worker |

## Manager rules

1. Only the manager sends `TASK_ASSIGN`.
2. Only the manager decides reassignment, retry, or cancellation.
3. The manager must rotate `lease_token` when reassigning a task.
4. The manager should mirror meaningful worker replies into the shared context files.
5. If a worker shows repeated confusion, drift, or closure failure, the manager should run the ProblemMap guard before rewriting the task.

## Worker rules

1. Reply to the manager pane using `tmux-bridge`, not only inside the local pane.
2. Echo the latest `lease_token` exactly.
3. Use `ASK` when context is insufficient instead of silently guessing.
4. Use `RESULT` or `FAIL` as the terminal message for an assignment.
5. If `tmux-bridge` is missing from `PATH`, use an absolute path or set `TMUX_BRIDGE_BIN`.

## Verb guidance

### `HELLO`

Used when a worker pane first joins the pool or when the manager probes capabilities.

```text
[wrk type:HELLO task:none worker:codex seq:1 reply:%0 context_seq:0 lease_token:none] caps="code,search,edit"
```

### `TASK_ASSIGN`

Manager sends work to a worker pane.

```text
[mgr type:TASK_ASSIGN task:task-123 worker:codex seq:45 reply:%0 context_seq:110 lease_token:lease-task-123] goal="Investigate failing auth tests" input="tests/ src/auth.ts" artifact_dir="/tmp/smux/artifacts"
```

### `TASK_ACCEPT`

Worker acknowledges ownership of the task.

```text
[wrk type:TASK_ACCEPT task:task-123 worker:codex seq:46 reply:%0 context_seq:110 lease_token:lease-task-123] note="Accepted and starting inspection"
```

### `HEARTBEAT`

Worker indicates continued liveness on a long-running task.

```text
[wrk type:HEARTBEAT task:task-123 worker:codex seq:47 reply:%0 context_seq:111 lease_token:lease-task-123] note="Still running"
```

### `STATUS`

Short progress or blocked-but-not-terminal update.

```text
[wrk type:STATUS task:task-123 worker:codex seq:48 reply:%0 context_seq:112 lease_token:lease-task-123] note="Narrowed failure to refresh-token branch"
```

### `ASK`

Worker asks for more context or a manager decision.

```text
[wrk type:ASK task:task-123 worker:codex seq:49 reply:%0 context_seq:112 lease_token:lease-task-123] question="Should I inspect only tests, or patch code too?"
```

### `RESULT`

Successful terminal reply. Prefer an artifact path for anything long.

```text
[wrk type:RESULT task:task-123 worker:codex seq:50 reply:%0 context_seq:113 lease_token:lease-task-123] artifact="/tmp/smux/artifacts/task-123.md" note="Root cause identified"
```

### `FAIL`

Terminal failure or refusal.

```text
[wrk type:FAIL task:task-123 worker:codex seq:51 reply:%0 context_seq:113 lease_token:lease-task-123] note="Missing repository access"
```

## Suggested state flow

```text
queued -> assigned -> running -> blocked/retry_wait -> done|failed|cancelled
```

For the smux-native MVP, this state flow may be tracked manually or with very light helper scripts.

## Practical friction seen in live validation

The first multi-pane validation surfaced two common mistakes:

1. Worker panes may not inherit the same `PATH`, so `tmux-bridge` lookup can fail.
2. After `type`, workers still need another `read` before `keys Enter`; otherwise read guard rejects the send.

That is why this skill ships `send-reply.sh` in addition to `send-task.sh`.

## Drift guard guidance

Run the manager-side ProblemMap guard when one or more of these happen:

1. Two or more `ASK` messages on the same task without a scope change.
2. Three or more `STATUS` messages with little movement toward a terminal answer.
3. A `FAIL` whose note suggests confusion, missing continuity, or broken execution closure.
4. A `RESULT` that appears off-target relative to the manager's stated goal.

The guard does not change the worker protocol. It diagnoses the current task trail from the shared context mirror and helps the manager decide between:

- re-grounding the task
- restoring continuity/context
- tightening task boundaries
- reassigning to another worker
